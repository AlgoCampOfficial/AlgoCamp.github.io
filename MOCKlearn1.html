                    <p style = "position: absolute; right: 10%; top: 1%; width:700px;">Algorithm means “a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations”. It refers to a set of rules/instructions that step-by-step define how a work is to be executed upon in order to get the expected results.</p>
                    <p style = "position: absolute; right: 10%; top: 25%; width:700px;">A programming algorithm describes how to do something, and your computer will do it exactly that way every time. Well, it will once you convert your algorithm into a language it understands.</p>

              <!-- DESCRIPTION | LEARN -->
              <p style = "position: absolute; right: 2%; top: 12%; width:880px;">| It's written in simple English (or whatever the programmer speaks). </p>
              <p style = "position: absolute; right: 2%; top: 19%; width:880px;">| It doesn't beat around the bush--it has a start, a middle, and an end. In fact, you will probably label the first step 'start' and the last step 'end.'</p>
              <p style = "position: absolute; right: 2%; top: 30%; width:880px;">| It includes only what you need to carry out the task. It does not include anything unclear, often called ambiguous in computer lingo, that someone reading it might wonder about.</p>
              <p style = "position: absolute; right: 2%; top: 42%; width:880px;">| It always leads to a solution and tries to be the most efficient solution we can think up. It's often a good idea to number the steps, but you don't have to. </p>
              <p style = "position: absolute; right: 2%; top: 52%; width:880px;">| Instead of numbered steps, some folks use indentation and write in pseudocode, which is a semi-programming language used to describe the steps in an algorithm. </p>
              <p style = "position: absolute; right: 2%; top: 62%; width:880px;">| An algorithm can be written as a list of steps using text or as a picture with shapes and arrows called a flowchart. </p>

          <p style = "position: absolute; right: 8%; top: 49%; width: 300px;">ASK THE USER FOR AN EMAIL ADDRESS </p>
          <p style = "position: absolute; right: 8%; top: 57%; width: 300px;">STORE THE RESPONSE IN THE VARIABLE </p>
          <p style = "position: absolute; right: 8%; top: 64%; width: 300px;">CHEEK THE STORED RESPONSE TO SEE IF IT IS A VALID EMAIL ADDRESS </p>
          <p style = "position: absolute; right: 8%; top: 74%; width: 300px;">NOT VALID? GO BAD, TO STEP 3</p>
          <p style = "position: absolute; right: 15%; top: 82%; width: 200px;">END</p>

            <p style = "position: absolute; right: 33%; top: 30%; width: 800px;">It can be understood by taking an example of cooking a new recipe. To cook a new recipe, one reads the instructions and steps and executes them one by one, in the given sequence. The result thus obtained is the new dish cooked perfectly. Similarly, algorithms help to do a task in programming to get the expected output.</p>
            <p style = "position: absolute; right: 33%; top: 55%; width: 800px;">The Algorithm designed are language-independent, they are just plain instructions that can be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same, as expected.</p>
